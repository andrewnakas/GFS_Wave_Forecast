# SOLUTION: How to Deploy to GitHub Pages

## The Problem
GitHub Actions tried to deploy but was rejected:
```
Branch "claude/gfs-wave-current-forecast-011CUvvhwdZcCKGFDNJBhjsv" is not allowed to deploy
to github-pages due to environment protection rules.
```

GitHub Pages only accepts deployments from `main` or `master` branches.

## The Solution (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Create Pull Request
Go to this URL (auto-generated by GitHub):
```
https://github.com/andrewnakas/GFS_Wave_Forecast/pull/new/claude/gfs-wave-current-forecast-011CUvvhwdZcCKGFDNJBhjsv
```

OR go to your repo and look for the yellow banner that says:
"**claude/gfs-wave-current-forecast-011CUvvhwdZcCKGFDNJBhjsv had recent pushes**"
Click "Compare & pull request"

### Step 2: Merge the PR
1. Click **"Create pull request"**
2. Click **"Merge pull request"**
3. Click **"Confirm merge"**

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment
- GitHub Actions will automatically trigger on the merge to `main`
- Watch at: https://github.com/andrewnakas/GFS_Wave_Forecast/actions
- Wait ~2 minutes for deployment
- Site will be live at: **https://andrewnakas.github.io/GFS_Wave_Forecast/**

## Why This Happens

GitHub Pages has environment protection rules that restrict which branches can deploy:
- ✅ `main` branch → Allowed
- ✅ `master` branch → Allowed
- ❌ Feature branches → Blocked (security feature)

This is a security feature to prevent unauthorized deployments.

## After Merging

Once merged to `main`:
1. The workflow will run automatically
2. No branch protection errors
3. Deployment will succeed
4. Your site goes live!

## Alternative: Change Environment Protection Rules

If you want to deploy from the feature branch, you'd need to:
1. Go to Settings → Environments → github-pages
2. Update deployment branches to allow any branch
3. But this is NOT recommended for security

**Just merge to main instead - it's the proper way!**

## Verify Everything is Ready

Before merging, verify:
- ✅ Settings → Pages → Source is "GitHub Actions"
- ✅ Workflow file exists (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- ✅ All code is committed and pushed to feature branch
- ✅ Local testing works (http://localhost:8000)

All good? **Merge to main now!**
