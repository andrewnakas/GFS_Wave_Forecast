# GFS Wave Forecast Visualization

An interactive web-based visualization of Global Forecast System (GFS) wave data with animated wave velocity vectors on a Leaflet map.

## Features

- **Real-time GFS wave forecast visualization** - Access the latest wave forecasts from NOAA
- **Animated wave vectors** - See wave direction and magnitude with dynamic arrows
- **Particle animation** - Watch particles flow with wave currents
- **Interactive map** - Zoom, pan, and click anywhere for detailed wave information
- **Time controls** - Navigate through 48 hours of forecast with play/pause controls
- **Customizable display** - Adjust vector scale and toggle layers
- **Color-coded wave heights** - Instantly identify wave intensity

## Quick Start

The easiest way to get started is to use the built-in sample data:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd GFS_Wave_Forecast

# Start the server
python backend/simple_server.py

# Open your browser to http://localhost:8000
```

That's it! The application will load with sample wave data and start animating.

## Data Source

Wave data is sourced from NOAA's **GFS Wave model** (WAVEWATCH III) via OpenDAP/THREDDS services:
- Primary: UCAR THREDDS Server
- Alternative: NOAA NOMADS Server
- Format: NetCDF/GRIB2
- Resolution: 0.25° (subsampled to ~1° for performance)
- Forecast: 16 days, 3-hour intervals

## Advanced Setup - Fetching Real GFS Data

To fetch real-time GFS wave forecast data from NOAA:

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Fetch Latest Data

```bash
# Run the data fetcher
python fetch_gfs_data.py
```

This will:
1. Connect to NOAA's THREDDS/OpenDAP servers
2. Download the latest GFS wave forecast
3. Process and save the data to `data/sample_data.json`
4. The web app will automatically use this data

Note: The data fetcher will fall back to generating sample data if:
- Network connectivity issues
- NOAA servers are unavailable
- Required Python packages are missing

## Usage Guide

### Basic Controls

1. **Map Navigation**
   - Click and drag to pan
   - Scroll to zoom in/out
   - Click anywhere on the ocean to see wave details

2. **Time Controls**
   - Use the slider to jump to any forecast time
   - Click **Play** to animate through the forecast
   - Click **Reset** to return to the start

3. **Display Options**
   - Toggle **Wave Vectors** to show/hide directional arrows
   - Toggle **Particle Animation** to show/hide particle flow
   - Adjust **Vector Scale** to change arrow size

4. **Wave Information**
   - Click any ocean point to see:
     - Wave height (meters)
     - Wave direction (degrees and compass direction)
     - Wave period (seconds)
     - Geographic coordinates

### Understanding the Visualization

- **Arrow Direction**: Shows where waves are traveling TO
- **Arrow Length**: Proportional to wave height
- **Arrow Color**:
  - Blue = Small waves (0-2m)
  - Cyan = Moderate waves (2-4m)
  - Orange = Large waves (4-6m)
  - Red = Very large waves (6m+)
- **Particles**: Flow with wave currents, showing overall wave patterns

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **Leaflet.js** (v1.9.4) - Interactive web mapping
- **Canvas API** - Custom vector and particle rendering
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No framework dependencies

### Backend
- **Python 3.8+** - Data processing
- **xarray** - Multi-dimensional array handling
- **NetCDF4** - NetCDF file access
- **cfgrib** - GRIB2 file decoding
- **NumPy** - Numerical computations

### Data Sources
- **NOAA GFS Wave** - Global wave forecasts
- **WAVEWATCH III** - Wave model
- **UCAR THREDDS** - OpenDAP data access
- **NOAA NOMADS** - Alternative data source

## Troubleshooting

### The map doesn't load
- Make sure you're running a web server (don't open `index.html` directly)
- Check browser console for errors
- Try `python backend/simple_server.py`

### No wave vectors showing
- Check that "Show Wave Vectors" is enabled in the control panel
- Try adjusting the vector scale slider
- Zoom in closer to the map

### Python data fetcher fails
- The app will work with sample data if real data fetch fails
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Python packages are installed: `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
- NOAA servers may be temporarily unavailable - try again later

### Performance issues
- The application uses ~3000 animated particles which may be intensive
- Try disabling particle animation in the control panel
- Close other browser tabs
- Zoom to a specific region instead of viewing the whole globe

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add backend API for automated data updates
- [ ] Implement WebSocket for real-time data streaming
- [ ] Add weather overlay (wind, pressure, temperature)
- [ ] Support for additional wave models (ECMWF, regional models)
- [ ] Historical wave data playback
- [ ] Export capabilities (images, data)
- [ ] Mobile-optimized interface
- [ ] Integration with weather forecast data
